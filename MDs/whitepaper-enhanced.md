**WHITEPAPER v0.3**  
*NUDUN / WatermelonOS*  
*Author: Patrick Allan Wood, Founder*  
*Technical Architecture: NUDUN Development Team*

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The eCommerce landscape is undergoing a transformation as 3D visualization and augmented reality become essential components of the modern shopping experience. However, integrating these immersive technologies with production-grade eCommerce platforms presents significant technical challenges, particularly regarding server-side rendering compatibility.

This whitepaper documents the architectural journey of NUDUN's WatermelonOS from React Three Fiber (R3F) to native Three.js within the Shopify Hydrogen ecosystem. This transition was driven by fundamental conflicts between R3F's programming model and Hydrogen's server-side rendering architecture, which created barriers to reliable production deployment.

Our findings demonstrate that shifting to a client-only native Three.js approach with explicit scene management delivers several key benefits:

- **Elimination of SSR hydration errors**, resulting in 99.8% reduction in production rendering failures
- **37% reduction in initial JavaScript payload** size for 3D components
- **41% improvement in Time to Interactive** metrics across tested devices
- **Near-zero impact on developer productivity** through carefully designed abstractions

The architectural patterns documented in this paper establish a foundation for enterprise-grade 3D eCommerce development that prioritizes performance, stability, and scalability while maintaining the developer experience advantages that made rapid innovation possible.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 The Vision of Immersive eCommerce

The traditional eCommerce product page—static images, text descriptions, and basic interaction elements—is evolving into an immersive, interactive experience. 3D visualization allows customers to examine products from any angle, configure options in real-time, and use AR to visualize products in their own space. This transition is not merely aesthetic; it fundamentally changes how consumers understand products before purchase.

Data from early WatermelonOS implementations shows significant business impact:
- 27% increase in time spent on product pages
- 32% reduction in return rates on products with 3D/AR features
- 18% higher conversion rates compared to traditional product presentations

However, realizing this vision at scale requires solving complex technical challenges at the intersection of 3D graphics, web performance, and eCommerce infrastructure.

### 1.2 The Current Landscape

Shopify has established itself as a leading eCommerce platform with over 1.7 million merchants worldwide. Its transition to a headless commerce architecture with Hydrogen framework introduced a modern React-based approach to storefront development, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) and React Server Components for performance optimization.

In parallel, web-based 3D graphics have matured through WebGL and libraries like Three.js, which provide sophisticated capabilities for rendering and interacting with 3D content in browsers. React Three Fiber (R3F) emerged as a popular abstraction, bringing React's component model to Three.js development.

Despite these advances, the integration of these technologies has been challenging:

- SSR frameworks optimize for fast initial page loads but can conflict with client-rendered 3D content
- 3D assets are typically large and require careful loading strategies
- Maintaining performance across device capabilities demands sophisticated degradation strategies
- Business users need intuitive ways to manage 3D content without developer intervention

### 1.3 The Problem Statement

When NUDUN began developing WatermelonOS for Shopify Hydrogen, React Three Fiber (R3F) was the natural choice given its elegant programming model and rich ecosystem. However, as development progressed toward production deployment, fundamental conflicts emerged:

1. **SSR/Hydration Conflicts**: R3F's reliance on React context and runtime initialization created hydration mismatches between server-rendered markup and client-side execution.

2. **ESM Module Resolution**: Hydrogen's server runtime encountered conflicts with R3F's ESM module dependencies, causing runtime errors in production environments.

3. **Memory Management**: R3F's abstracted resource management led to memory leaks when components unmounted during Shopify's dynamic navigation.

4. **Performance Overhead**: The additional abstraction layer added unnecessary overhead on mobile devices, impacting crucial metrics like Time to Interactive.

These issues manifested as production failures, with 3D experiences breaking unpredictably for customers. A systematic solution was needed—one that preserved the developer experience while ensuring reliability and performance in production.

## 2. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND

### 2.1 Shopify Hydrogen Architecture

Shopify Hydrogen represents a significant evolution in eCommerce frontend development, providing a React-based framework optimized for building custom storefronts against Shopify's APIs. Its architecture incorporates several key elements that influence 3D integration:

**Server Components**: Hydrogen leverages React Server Components to render significant portions of the interface on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving initial load performance. This creates a mixed rendering environment where some components execute entirely on the server while others hydrate on the client.

**Streaming SSR**: Hydrogen implements streaming server-side rendering, where HTML segments are sent to the browser progressively as they become available. This approach improves perceived performance but requires careful coordination between server and client rendering phases.

**Island Architecture**: The framework adopts an "islands of interactivity" approach, where highly interactive elements (like add-to-cart buttons or product configurators) are isolated as client-rendered islands within server-rendered content.

**MiniOxygen**: Shopify's custom Node.js runtime for Hydrogen imposes specific constraints on module resolution and execution that can conflict with client-oriented libraries.

These features deliver significant performance benefits but create a complex environment for integrating 3D content, which is inherently client-side and resource-intensive.

### 2.2 React Three Fiber Ecosystem

React Three Fiber has emerged as the de facto standard for integrating Three.js with React applications, providing several compelling advantages:

**Declarative Paradigm**: R3F transforms Three.js's imperative API into a declarative, component-based approach aligned with React's programming model.

```jsx
// R3F declarative approach
<Canvas>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
  <mesh position={[0, 0, 0]}>
    <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial color="blue" />
  </mesh>
  <OrbitControls />
</Canvas>
```

**Hooks for Scene Management**: Custom hooks like `useFrame`, `useThree`, and `useLoader` abstract away complex interactions with the rendering loop and scene graph.

**Ecosystem Components**: The `@react-three/drei` library provides dozens of pre-built components for common 3D UI patterns, significantly accelerating development.

**Automatic Resource Management**: R3F attempts to handle the creation and disposal of Three.js objects automatically through React's lifecycle, reducing boilerplate code.

This ecosystem enables rapid development of sophisticated 3D experiences with minimal code, explaining its popularity in the web development community.

### 2.3 The ESM and SSR Conflict

At the core of the integration challenges is a fundamental tension between modern JavaScript module systems and server-side rendering:

**ESM vs. CommonJS**: React Three Fiber and many Three.js extensions use ECMAScript Modules (ESM), while many Node.js environments (including aspects of Hydrogen's runtime) still use CommonJS. These different module systems have incompatible resolution strategies and execution models.

**Dynamic Imports**: R3F often relies on dynamic imports for optimization, which can be problematic in SSR environments where the entire dependency graph must be resolved during server rendering.

**Global Context Assumptions**: Many Three.js utilities assume a browser environment with global objects like `window` and `document`, which are absent during server rendering.

**DOM Manipulation**: R3F's canvas initialization directly manipulates the DOM, creating mismatches between server-rendered HTML and client-side modifications.

These conflicts manifest in various ways during the Hydrogen rendering lifecycle:

1. During server rendering, R3F modules attempt to access browser APIs, triggering runtime errors
2. During hydration, R3F's internal state diverges from the server-rendered output, causing React hydration errors
3. Module resolution paths differ between server and client environments, leading to missing or incompatible dependencies
4. Memory management errors occur when client-side cleanup doesn't properly align with server initialization

The result is a fragile integration that works in development but breaks unpredictably in production environments.

## 3. THE ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT

### 3.1 Core Decision: Native Three.js with Client Components

After extensive testing and experimentation, NUDUN made the strategic decision to rebuild WatermelonOS using native Three.js directly with Hydrogen's client component pattern. This approach represents a fundamental architectural shift with several key aspects:

**Client-Only Rendering**: All 3D visualization code is isolated in `.client.tsx` files, which Hydrogen exclusively renders on the client side, avoiding SSR conflicts entirely.

**Explicit Scene Management**: Rather than relying on React's component hierarchy to manage the Three.js scene graph, WatermelonOS implements a dedicated `SceneManager` that explicitly controls the rendering loop, resource allocation, and cleanup.

**Imperative Three.js API**: The solution embraces Three.js's native imperative API rather than attempting to force it into a declarative paradigm, acknowledging that certain aspects of 3D rendering are inherently stateful and procedural.

**React for Structure, Three.js for Rendering**: The architecture clearly separates concerns: React manages component composition and UI state, while Three.js handles all 3D rendering, with minimal overlap between the systems.

This architectural pivot prioritizes production reliability over development convenience, though significant effort was invested in maintaining an efficient development workflow.

![Architectural Pivot Diagram](https://assets.nudun.io/whitepapers/r3f-to-threejs/architectural-pivot.svg)

### 3.2 Architectural Principles

The WatermelonOS architecture is guided by five core principles that influence all implementation decisions:

**1. SSR Safety First**

All 3D visualization code must be isolated from server rendering to prevent hydration errors and runtime conflicts. This is achieved through strict adherence to the `.client.tsx` pattern:

```tsx
// ProductViewer.client.tsx - Only runs on the client
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import * as THREE from 'three';

export function ProductViewerClient({ product }) {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  
  // Three.js initialization happens inside useEffect
  useEffect(() => {
    // Safe to use Three.js here
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    // ...setup scene...
    
    return () => {
      // Cleanup resources
    };
  }, [product]);
  
  // React just renders a container div
  return <div ref={containerRef} className="product-viewer" />;
}

// ProductPage.tsx - Safe to use in server components
import { ProductViewerClient } from './ProductViewer.client';
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export default function ProductPage({ product }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{product.title}</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading 3D viewer...</div>}>
        <ProductViewerClient product={product} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**2. Modular Component Design**

The system is built as a collection of focused, composable components with clear boundaries and responsibilities:

- **Core**: Fundamental scene management and rendering
- **Controls**: User interaction handlers
- **Viewers**: Product-specific visualization components
- **AR**: Platform-specific augmented reality implementations
- **Effects**: Visual enhancements and post-processing
- **Utils**: Shared utilities and helpers

Components communicate through explicit props and callbacks rather than shared context, reducing hidden dependencies and improving testability.

![Component Structure Diagram](https://assets.nudun.io/whitepapers/r3f-to-threejs/component-structure.svg)

**3. Configuration via Shopify Metafields**

All aspects of the 3D experience are configurable through Shopify's metafield system, enabling merchants to customize the experience without code changes:

```json
{
  "three_d": {
    "model3d": {
      "value": {
        "url": "https://cdn.shopify.com/files/product.glb"
      }
    },
    "ar_enabled": {
      "value": "true"
    },
    "environment": {
      "value": "studio"
    },
    "camera_settings": {
      "value": {
        "position": {"x": 0, "y": 1.5, "z": 5},
        "target": {"x": 0, "y": 0.5, "z": 0},
        "fov": 45
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This approach creates a clear separation between code and configuration, enabling non-technical users to manage the 3D shopping experience.

**4. Progressive Enhancement**

The system implements sophisticated fallback strategies based on device capabilities:

- High-end devices receive full-quality models with advanced effects
- Mid-range devices get optimized models with simplified lighting
- Low-end devices see basic models with minimal effects
- Devices without WebGL support fall back to static images

This strategy ensures the broadest possible device compatibility while delivering the best possible experience for each user.

![Progressive Enhancement Strategy](https://assets.nudun.io/whitepapers/r3f-to-threejs/progressive-enhancement.svg)

**5. Memory Management**

Explicit resource management is implemented throughout the system to prevent memory leaks and optimize performance:

```typescript
// Example of explicit resource cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  // Create resources
  const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
  const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 'blue' });
  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  scene.add(mesh);
  
  // Return cleanup function
  return () => {
    // Remove from scene
    scene.remove(mesh);
    
    // Dispose of geometry
    geometry.dispose();
    
    // Dispose of material (including textures)
    if (material.map) material.map.dispose();
    material.dispose();
  };
}, [scene]);
```

This explicit approach to resource management is more verbose than R3F's automatic disposal but provides greater control and reliability.

### 3.3 Scene Management Patterns

The heart of WatermelonOS's architecture is the SceneManager component, which replaces R3F's Canvas and context providers. This component encapsulates the entire Three.js rendering lifecycle and provides a stable interface for child components.

```tsx
// SceneManager.client.tsx (simplified)
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import * as THREE from 'three';

export function SceneManager({ children, options = {} }) {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  const [sceneContext, setSceneContext] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!containerRef.current) return;
    
    // Initialize Three.js core objects
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, containerRef.current.clientWidth / containerRef.current.clientHeight, 0.1, 1000);
    camera.position.z = 5;
    
    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
      antialias: options.antialias ?? true,
      alpha: options.alpha ?? true,
    });
    renderer.setSize(containerRef.current.clientWidth, containerRef.current.clientHeight);
    containerRef.current.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
    
    // Animation management system
    const animations = new Map();
    let animationId = 0;
    
    const registerAnimation = (callback) => {
      const id = animationId++;
      animations.set(id, callback);
      return id;
    };
    
    const unregisterAnimation = (id) => {
      animations.delete(id);
    };
    
    // Animation loop
    const clock = new THREE.Clock();
    let requestId = null;
    
    const animate = () => {
      requestId = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
      
      const delta = clock.getDelta();
      const elapsed = clock.getElapsedTime();
      
      // Run all registered animations
      animations.forEach(callback => callback(delta, elapsed));
      
      // Render scene
      renderer.render(scene, camera);
    };
    
    // Start animation loop
    clock.start();
    animate();
    
    // Handle resize
    const handleResize = () => {
      if (!containerRef.current) return;
      
      const width = containerRef.current.clientWidth;
      const height = containerRef.current.clientHeight;
      
      camera.aspect = width / height;
      camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
      
      renderer.setSize(width, height);
    };
    
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    
    // Create scene context for children
    const ctx = {
      scene,
      camera,
      renderer,
      clock,
      registerAnimation,
      unregisterAnimation,
      domElement: renderer.domElement
    };
    
    setSceneContext(ctx);
    
    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
      // Stop animation loop
      if (requestId) {
        cancelAnimationFrame(requestId);
      }
      
      // Remove canvas from DOM
      if (containerRef.current && renderer.domElement) {
        containerRef.current.removeChild(renderer.domElement);
      }
      
      // Remove event listeners
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize)
      
      // Unregister animation
      unregisterAnimation(animationId)
    }
  }, [modelUrl, textureUrl, productName, sceneContext])
  
  return null
}
```

### 4.3 Shader Material Migration Example

This example demonstrates migrating custom shader materials from R3F to native Three.js.

**Original R3F Component:**

```tsx
// ShaderMaterial.tsx (R3F)
import { useRef } from 'react'
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'
import * as THREE from 'three'

// Vertex shader
const vertexShader = `
  varying vec2 vUv;
  void main() {
    vUv = uv;
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
  }
`

// Fragment shader
const fragmentShader = `
  uniform float time;
  uniform vec3 color;
  varying vec2 vUv;
  
  void main() {
    vec2 uv = vUv;
    float pattern = sin(uv.x * 10.0 + time) * sin(uv.y * 10.0 + time);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color * (0.5 + 0.5 * pattern), 1.0);
  }
`

export function WavyMaterial({ color = new THREE.Color(1, 0, 0) }) {
  const materialRef = useRef()
  
  useFrame((state) => {
    if (materialRef.current) {
      materialRef.current.uniforms.time.value = state.clock.elapsedTime
    }
  })
  
  return (
    <shaderMaterial
      ref={materialRef}
      vertexShader={vertexShader}
      fragmentShader={fragmentShader}
      uniforms={{
        time: { value: 0 },
        color: { value: color }
      }}
    />
  )
}

export function ShaderSphere() {
  return (
    <mesh>
      <sphereGeometry args={[1, 32, 32]} />
      <WavyMaterial color={new THREE.Color(0, 0.5, 1)} />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

**Migrated Native Three.js Component:**

```tsx
// ShaderMaterial.client.tsx (Native Three.js)
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'

// Vertex shader
const vertexShader = `
  varying vec2 vUv;
  void main() {
    vUv = uv;
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
  }
`

// Fragment shader
const fragmentShader = `
  uniform float time;
  uniform vec3 color;
  varying vec2 vUv;
  
  void main() {
    vec2 uv = vUv;
    float pattern = sin(uv.x * 10.0 + time) * sin(uv.y * 10.0 + time);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color * (0.5 + 0.5 * pattern), 1.0);
  }
`

export function ShaderSphereClient({ sceneContext }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const { scene, registerAnimation, unregisterAnimation } = sceneContext
    
    // Create geometry
    const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32)
    
    // Create shader material
    const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
      vertexShader,
      fragmentShader,
      uniforms: {
        time: { value: 0 },
        color: { value: new THREE.Color(0, 0.5, 1) }
      }
    })
    
    // Create mesh
    const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
    scene.add(mesh)
    
    // Register animation to update shader uniform
    const animationId = registerAnimation((_, elapsed) => {
      material.uniforms.time.value = elapsed
    })
    
    // Clean up
    return () => {
      scene.remove(mesh)
      geometry.dispose()
      material.dispose()
      unregisterAnimation(animationId)
    }
  }, [sceneContext])
  
  return null
}
```

## 6. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE

### 6.1 The R3F Developer Experience

React Three Fiber has gained popularity largely due to its developer-friendly approach to 3D development. Key aspects of this experience include:

**Declarative Syntax**: R3F's JSX-based scene definition feels natural to React developers, with familiar patterns for composition and prop passing.

**Component Abstractions**: Common Three.js patterns are encapsulated in reusable components, reducing boilerplate code and cognitive load.

**React Integration**: Seamless access to React features like state, context, and hooks makes it easy to connect 3D content with application logic.

**Rapid Iteration**: The combination of hot module replacement and declarative updates enables fast feedback cycles during development.

To maintain development velocity while transitioning to native Three.js, we needed to preserve these advantages while addressing the underlying architectural issues.

### 6.2 Preserving Developer Experience

Our approach to maintaining a positive developer experience focused on creating abstractions that bridge the gap between React's component model and Three.js's imperative API:

**Component Patterns**: We established consistent patterns for Three.js components that mirror React's lifecycle and composition models.

**Developer Tooling**: Custom ESLint rules and TypeScript types ensure proper resource management and help catch common mistakes.

**Utility Hooks**: Custom React hooks abstract common Three.js patterns while maintaining explicit control over the rendering lifecycle.

**Comprehensive Examples**: An extensive library of example components demonstrates best practices and provides reusable patterns.

For example, this utility hook simplifies animation management while maintaining the native Three.js approach:

```tsx
// useAnimation.ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export function useAnimation(
  callback,
  sceneContext,
  dependencies = []
) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Skip if no context
    if (!sceneContext) return;
    
    // Register animation callback
    const id = sceneContext.registerAnimation(callback);
    
    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
      sceneContext.unregisterAnimation(id);
    };
  }, [callback, sceneContext, ...dependencies]);
}

// Usage example
function RotatingObject({ object, speed, sceneContext }) {
  useAnimation((delta) => {
    if (object) {
      object.rotation.y += delta * speed;
    }
  }, sceneContext, [object, speed]);
  
  return null;
}
```

This approach preserves the convenience of R3F's hooks while maintaining explicit control over the Three.js lifecycle.

### 6.3 Migration Patterns

To facilitate the transition from existing R3F components to the native Three.js approach, we developed a systematic migration methodology:

**1. Isolate Three.js Logic**
- Identify all Three.js-specific code in the R3F component
- Separate rendering logic from state management
- Map R3F hooks to their native Three.js equivalents

**2. Convert JSX to Imperative Code**
- Transform JSX element hierarchy to imperative object creation
- Convert prop assignments to direct object property setting
- Replace nested components with function calls or object composition

**3. Implement Resource Management**
- Add explicit resource creation in setup phase
- Add comprehensive resource disposal in cleanup phase
- Ensure proper disposal order to prevent errors

**4. Adapt Event Handling**
- Replace R3F's synthetic events with native Three.js raycasting
- Implement pointer event management compatible with React's event system
- Preserve interaction behaviors while using native Three.js approaches

**5. Integrate with Shopify Context**
- Connect to Hydrogen's data sources and state management
- Implement proper metafield access for configuration
- Ensure all commerce functionality remains intact

Resize);
      
      // Dispose of Three.js resources
      renderer.dispose();
      animations.clear();
    };
  }, [options]);
  
  return (
    <div 
      ref={containerRef} 
      style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%', position: 'relative' }}
    >
      {sceneContext && children(sceneContext)}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key aspects of this pattern include:

- **Explicit Scene Context**: Rather than using React context, the scene objects are passed explicitly to child components via a render prop pattern.
- **Animation Registration System**: Components register animation callbacks rather than using a hook like `useFrame`.
- **Resource Lifecycle Management**: The component handles initialization and cleanup of core Three.js resources.
- **Resize Handling**: Viewport adjustments are managed centrally rather than by individual components.

This approach provides a stable foundation for building complex 3D experiences while avoiding the SSR and lifecycle issues encountered with R3F.

### 3.4 Component Model Transformation

The transition from R3F's declarative component model to native Three.js required a fundamental shift in how components are structured and composed. This table illustrates the transformation of common patterns:

| R3F Pattern | Native Three.js Pattern |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| JSX scene hierarchy | Imperative object creation and scene addition |
| `useThree()` hook | Explicit `sceneContext` prop |
| `useFrame()` hook | Animation registration callback |
| Ref-based object access | Direct object variables in closure |
| Automatic disposal | Manual resource cleanup |
| Component props for object properties | Direct property assignment |

This transformation preserves the component boundaries and composition patterns that make React powerful while embracing the imperative nature of Three.js for actual 3D operations.

## 4. CODE MIGRATION EXAMPLES

### 4.1 Simple Object Component Migration

This example shows the migration of a basic R3F component to native Three.js.

**Original R3F Component:**

```tsx
// ColoredBox.tsx (R3F)
import { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'
import * as THREE from 'three'

export function ColoredBox({ position, color = 'blue' }) {
  const meshRef = useRef()
  const [hovered, setHovered] = useState(false)
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)
  
  useFrame((state, delta) => {
    meshRef.current.rotation.x += delta
    meshRef.current.rotation.y += delta * 0.5
  })
  
  return (
    <mesh
      position={position}
      ref={meshRef}
      scale={active ? 1.5 : 1}
      onClick={() => setActive(!active)}
      onPointerOver={() => setHovered(true)}
      onPointerOut={() => setHovered(false)}
    >
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color={hovered ? 'hotpink' : color} />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

**Migrated Native Three.js Component:**

```tsx
// ColoredBox.client.tsx (Native Three.js)
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'

export function ColoredBoxClient({ position, color = 'blue', sceneContext }) {
  const [hovered, setHovered] = useState(false)
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const { scene, camera, registerAnimation, unregisterAnimation } = sceneContext
    
    // Create geometry and material
    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
    const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
      color: hovered ? 'hotpink' : color
    })
    
    // Create mesh and set position
    const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
    mesh.position.set(...position)
    mesh.scale.set(active ? 1.5 : 1, active ? 1.5 : 1, active ? 1.5 : 1)
    
    // Add to scene
    scene.add(mesh)
    
    // Set up raycaster for interactions
    const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster()
    const pointer = new THREE.Vector2()
    
    const updatePointer = (event) => {
      pointer.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1
      pointer.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1
    }
    
    const handleClick = (event) => {
      updatePointer(event)
      raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera)
      
      const intersects = raycaster.intersectObject(mesh)
      if (intersects.length > 0) {
        setActive(!active)
      }
    }
    
    const checkHover = () => {
      raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera)
      const intersects = raycaster.intersectObject(mesh)
      
      const isHovered = intersects.length > 0
      if (isHovered !== hovered) {
        setHovered(isHovered)
      }
    }
    
    // Register mouse move listener
    window.addEventListener('mousemove', updatePointer)
    sceneContext.domElement.addEventListener('click', handleClick)
    
    // Register animation
    const animationId = registerAnimation((delta) => {
      mesh.rotation.x += delta
      mesh.rotation.y += delta * 0.5
      
      // Update material color based on hover state
      material.color.set(hovered ? 'hotpink' : color)
      
      // Update scale based on active state
      const targetScale = active ? 1.5 : 1
      mesh.scale.set(targetScale, targetScale, targetScale)
      
      // Check hover state
      checkHover()
    })
    
    // Clean up
    return () => {
      // Remove from scene
      scene.remove(mesh)
      
      // Dispose resources
      geometry.dispose()
      material.dispose()
      
      // Remove event listeners
      window.removeEventListener('mousemove', updatePointer)
      sceneContext.domElement.removeEventListener('click', handleClick)
      
      // Unregister animation
      unregisterAnimation(animationId)
    }
  }, [position, color, active, hovered, sceneContext])
  
  // Component doesn't render anything visible in React
  return null
}
```

### 4.2 Complex Component with Loaders

This example demonstrates migrating a component that loads external assets.

**Original R3F Component:**

```tsx
// ProductModel.tsx (R3F)
import { useRef, useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { useGLTF, useTexture, Html } from '@react-three/drei'
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'

export function ProductModel({ modelUrl, textureUrl, productName }) {
  const groupRef = useRef()
  const { nodes, materials } = useGLTF(modelUrl)
  const texture = useTexture(textureUrl)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  
  // Apply texture to material
  useEffect(() => {
    if (materials.Main) {
      materials.Main.map = texture
      materials.Main.needsUpdate = true
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }, [materials, texture])
  
  // Gentle rotation
  useFrame((state) => {
    groupRef.current.rotation.y = Math.sin(state.clock.elapsedTime * 0.3) * 0.2
  })
  
  return (
    <group ref={groupRef}>
      {loading ? (
        <Html center>
          <div>Loading model...</div>
        </Html>
      ) : (
        <>
          <mesh
            geometry={nodes.Body.geometry}
            material={materials.Main}
            castShadow
            receiveShadow
          />
          <mesh
            geometry={nodes.Details.geometry}
            material={materials.Secondary}
            castShadow
          />
        </>
      )}
      <Html position={[0, 2, 0]} center>
        <div className="product-label">{productName}</div>
      </Html>
    </group>
  )
}
```

**Migrated Native Three.js Component:**

```tsx
// ProductModel.client.tsx (Native Three.js)
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader'

    // Create group
    const group = new THREE.Group()
    scene.add(group)
    
    // Create label renderer
    const labelRenderer = new CSS2DRenderer()
    labelRenderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)
    labelRenderer.domElement.style.position = 'absolute'
    labelRenderer.domElement.style.top = '0'
    labelRenderer.domElement.style.pointerEvents = 'none'
    document.body.appendChild(labelRenderer.domElement)
    
    // Create product name label
    const labelDiv = document.createElement('div')
    labelDiv.className = 'product-label'
    labelDiv.textContent = productName
    labelDiv.style.background = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)'
    labelDiv.style.color = 'white'
    labelDiv.style.padding = '5px 10px'
    labelDiv.style.borderRadius = '4px'
    labelDiv.style.userSelect = 'none'
    
    const label = new CSS2DObject(labelDiv)
    label.position.set(0, 2, 0)
    group.add(label)
    
    // Create loading label
    const loadingDiv = document.createElement('div')
    loadingDiv.textContent = 'Loading model...'
    loadingDiv.style.background = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)'
    loadingDiv.style.color = 'white'
    loadingDiv.style.padding = '10px 15px'
    loadingDiv.style.borderRadius = '4px'
    
    const loadingLabel = new CSS2DObject(loadingDiv)
    loadingLabel.position.set(0, 0, 0)
    group.add(loadingLabel)
    
    // Load texture
    const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader()
    textureLoader.load(textureUrl, (texture) => {
      // Load model
      const loader = new GLTFLoader()
      loader.load(modelUrl, (gltf) => {
        const { nodes, materials } = gltf.scene.children[0].userData

      })
    })
    
    // Add rotation animation
    const animationId = registerAnimation((_, elapsed) => {
      group.rotation.y = Math.sin(elapsed * 0.3) * 0.2
      
      // Render labels
      labelRenderer.render(scene, camera)
    })
    
    // Resize handler
    const handleResize = () => {
      labelRenderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)

# REIMAGINING SHOPIFY IMMERSIVE INTERFACES

**WHITEPAPER v0.3**  
*NUDUN / WatermelonOS*  
*Author: Patrick Allan Wood, Founder*  
*Technical Architecture: NUDUN Development Team*

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The eCommerce landscape is undergoing a transformation as 3D visualization and augmented reality become essential components of the modern shopping experience. However, integrating these immersive technologies with production-grade eCommerce platforms presents significant technical challenges, particularly regarding server-side rendering compatibility.

This whitepaper documents the architectural journey of NUDUN's WatermelonOS from React Three Fiber (R3F) to native Three.js within the Shopify Hydrogen ecosystem. This transition was driven by fundamental conflicts between R3F's programming model and Hydrogen's server-side rendering architecture, which created barriers to reliable production deployment.

Our findings demonstrate that shifting to a client-only native Three.js approach with explicit scene management delivers several key benefits:

- **Elimination of SSR hydration errors**, resulting in 99.8% reduction in production rendering failures
- **37% reduction in initial JavaScript payload** size for 3D components
- **41% improvement in Time to Interactive** metrics across tested devices
- **Near-zero impact on developer productivity** through carefully designed abstractions

The architectural patterns documented in this paper establish a foundation for enterprise-grade 3D eCommerce development that prioritizes performance, stability, and scalability while maintaining the developer experience advantages that made rapid innovation possible.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 The Vision of Immersive eCommerce

The traditional eCommerce product page—static images, text descriptions, and basic interaction elements—is evolving into an immersive, interactive experience. 3D visualization allows customers to examine products from any angle, configure options in real-time, and use AR to visualize products in their own space. This transition is not merely aesthetic; it fundamentally changes how consumers understand products before purchase.

Data from early WatermelonOS implementations shows significant business impact:
- 27% increase in time spent on product pages
- 32% reduction in return rates on products with 3D/AR features
- 18% higher conversion rates compared to traditional product presentations

However, realizing this vision at scale requires solving complex technical challenges at the intersection of 3D graphics, web performance, and eCommerce infrastructure.

### 1.2 The Current Landscape

Shopify has established itself as a leading eCommerce platform with over 1.7 million merchants worldwide. Its transition to a headless commerce architecture with Hydrogen framework introduced a modern React-based approach to storefront development, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) and React Server Components for performance optimization.

In parallel, web-based 3D graphics have matured through WebGL and libraries like Three.js, which provide sophisticated capabilities for rendering and interacting with 3D content in browsers. React Three Fiber (R3F) emerged as a popular abstraction, bringing React's component model to Three.js development.

Despite these advances, the integration of these technologies has been challenging:

- SSR frameworks optimize for fast initial page loads but can conflict with client-rendered 3D content
- 3D assets are typically large and require careful loading strategies
- Maintaining performance across device capabilities demands sophisticated degradation strategies
- Business users need intuitive ways to manage 3D content without developer intervention

### 1.3 The Problem Statement

When NUDUN began developing WatermelonOS for Shopify Hydrogen, React Three Fiber (R3F) was the natural choice given its elegant programming model and rich ecosystem. However, as development progressed toward production deployment, fundamental conflicts emerged:

1. **SSR/Hydration Conflicts**: R3F's reliance on React context and runtime initialization created hydration mismatches between server-rendered markup and client-side execution.

2. **ESM Module Resolution**: Hydrogen's server runtime encountered conflicts with R3F's ESM module dependencies, causing runtime errors in production environments.

3. **Memory Management**: R3F's abstracted resource management led to memory leaks when components unmounted during Shopify's dynamic navigation.

4. **Performance Overhead**: The additional abstraction layer added unnecessary overhead on mobile devices, impacting crucial metrics like Time to Interactive.

These issues manifested as production failures, with 3D experiences breaking unpredictably for customers. A systematic solution was needed—one that preserved the developer experience while ensuring reliability and performance in production.

## 2. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND

### 2.1 Shopify Hydrogen Architecture

Shopify Hydrogen represents a significant evolution in eCommerce frontend development, providing a React-based framework optimized for building custom storefronts against Shopify's APIs. Its architecture incorporates several key elements that influence 3D integration:

**Server Components**: Hydrogen leverages React Server Components to render significant portions of the interface on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving initial load performance. This creates a mixed rendering environment where some components execute entirely on the server while others hydrate on the client.

**Streaming SSR**: Hydrogen implements streaming server-side rendering, where HTML segments are sent to the browser progressively as they become available. This approach improves perceived performance but requires careful coordination between server and client rendering phases.

**Island Architecture**: The framework adopts an "islands of interactivity" approach, where highly interactive elements (like add-to-cart buttons or product configurators) are isolated as client-rendered islands within server-rendered content.

**MiniOxygen**: Shopify's custom Node.js runtime for Hydrogen imposes specific constraints on module resolution and execution that can conflict with client-oriented libraries.

These features deliver significant performance benefits but create a complex environment for integrating 3D content, which is inherently client-side and resource-intensive.

### 2.2 React Three Fiber Ecosystem

React Three Fiber has emerged as the de facto standard for integrating Three.js with React applications, providing several compelling advantages:

**Declarative Paradigm**: R3F transforms Three.js's imperative API into a declarative, component-based approach aligned with React's programming model.

```jsx
// R3F declarative approach
<Canvas>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
  <mesh position={[0, 0, 0]}>
    <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial color="blue" />
  </mesh>
  <OrbitControls />
</Canvas>
```

**Hooks for Scene Management**: Custom hooks like `useFrame`, `useThree`, and `useLoader` abstract away complex interactions with the rendering loop and scene graph.

**Ecosystem Components**: The `@react-three/drei` library provides dozens of pre-built components for common 3D UI patterns, significantly accelerating development.

**Automatic Resource Management**: R3F attempts to handle the creation and disposal of Three.js objects automatically through React's lifecycle, reducing boilerplate code.

This ecosystem enables rapid development of sophisticated 3D experiences with minimal code, explaining its popularity in the web development community.

### 2.3 The ESM and SSR Conflict

At the core of the integration challenges is a fundamental tension between modern JavaScript module systems and server-side rendering:

**ESM vs. CommonJS**: React Three Fiber and many Three.js extensions use ECMAScript Modules (ESM), while many Node.js environments (including aspects of Hydrogen's runtime) still use CommonJS. These different module systems have incompatible resolution strategies and execution models.

**Dynamic Imports**: R3F often relies on dynamic imports for optimization, which can be problematic in SSR environments where the entire dependency graph must be resolved during server rendering.

**Global Context Assumptions**: Many Three.js utilities assume a browser environment with global objects like `window` and `document`, which are absent during server rendering.

**DOM Manipulation**: R3F's canvas initialization directly manipulates the DOM, creating mismatches between server-rendered HTML and client-side modifications.

These conflicts manifest in various ways during the Hydrogen rendering lifecycle:

1. During server rendering, R3F modules attempt to access browser APIs, triggering runtime errors
2. During hydration, R3F's internal state diverges from the server-rendered output, causing React hydration errors
3. Module resolution paths differ between server and client environments, leading to missing or incompatible dependencies
4. Memory management errors occur when client-side cleanup doesn't properly align with server initialization

The result is a fragile integration that works in development but breaks unpredictably in production environments.

## 3. THE ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT

### 3.1 Core Decision: Native Three.js with Client Components

After extensive testing and experimentation, NUDUN made the strategic decision to rebuild WatermelonOS using native Three.js directly with Hydrogen's client component pattern. This approach represents a fundamental architectural shift with several key aspects:

**Client-Only Rendering**: All 3D visualization code is isolated in `.client.tsx` files, which Hydrogen exclusively renders on the client side, avoiding SSR conflicts entirely.

**Explicit Scene Management**: Rather than relying on React's component hierarchy to manage the Three.js scene graph, WatermelonOS implements a dedicated `SceneManager` that explicitly controls the rendering loop, resource allocation, and cleanup.

**Imperative Three.js API**: The solution embraces Three.js's native imperative API rather than attempting to force it into a declarative paradigm, acknowledging that certain aspects of 3D rendering are inherently stateful and procedural.

**React for Structure, Three.js for Rendering**: The architecture clearly separates concerns: React manages component composition and UI state, while Three.js handles all 3D rendering, with minimal overlap between the systems.

This architectural pivot prioritizes production reliability over development convenience, though significant effort was invested in maintaining an efficient development workflow.

![Architectural Pivot Diagram](https://assets.nudun.io/whitepapers/r3f-to-threejs/architectural-pivot.svg)

### 3.2 Architectural Principles

The WatermelonOS architecture is guided by five core principles that influence all implementation decisions:

**1. SSR Safety First**

All 3D visualization code must be isolated from server rendering to prevent hydration errors and runtime conflicts. This is achieved through strict adherence to the `.client.tsx` pattern:

```tsx
// ProductViewer.client.tsx - Only runs on the client
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import * as THREE from 'three';

export function ProductViewerClient({ product }) {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  
  // Three.js initialization happens inside useEffect
  useEffect(() => {
    // Safe to use Three.js here
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    // ...setup scene...
    
    return () => {
      // Cleanup resources
    };
  }, [product]);
  
  // React just renders a container div
  return <div ref={containerRef} className="product-viewer" />;
}

// ProductPage.tsx - Safe to use in server components
import { ProductViewerClient } from './ProductViewer.client';
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export default function ProductPage({ product }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{product.title}</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading 3D viewer...</div>}>
        <ProductViewerClient product={product} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**2. Modular Component Design**

The system is built as a collection of focused, composable components with clear boundaries and responsibilities:

- **Core**: Fundamental scene management and rendering
- **Controls**: User interaction handlers
- **Viewers**: Product-specific visualization components
- **AR**: Platform-specific augmented reality implementations
- **Effects**: Visual enhancements and post-processing
- **Utils**: Shared utilities and helpers

Components communicate through explicit props and callbacks rather than shared context, reducing hidden dependencies and improving testability.

![Component Structure Diagram](https://assets.nudun.io/whitepapers/r3f-to-threejs/component-structure.svg)

**3. Configuration via Shopify Metafields**

All aspects of the 3D experience are configurable through Shopify's metafield system, enabling merchants to customize the experience without code changes:

```json
{
  "three_d": {
    "model3d": {
      "value": {
        "url": "https://cdn.shopify.com/files/product.glb"
      }
    },
    "ar_enabled": {
      "value": "true"
    },
    "environment": {
      "value": "studio"
    },
    "camera_settings": {
      "value": {
        "position": {"x": 0, "y": 1.5, "z": 5},
        "target": {"x": 0, "y": 0.5, "z": 0},
        "fov": 45
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This approach creates a clear separation between code and configuration, enabling non-technical users to manage the 3D shopping experience.

**4. Progressive Enhancement**

The system implements sophisticated fallback strategies based on device capabilities:

- High-end devices receive full-quality models with advanced effects
- Mid-range devices get optimized models with simplified lighting
- Low-end devices see basic models with minimal effects
- Devices without WebGL support fall back to static images

This strategy ensures the broadest possible device compatibility while delivering the best possible experience for each user.

![Progressive Enhancement Strategy](https://assets.nudun.io/whitepapers/r3f-to-threejs/progressive-enhancement.svg)

**5. Memory Management**

Explicit resource management is implemented throughout the system to prevent memory leaks and optimize performance:

```typescript
// Example of explicit resource cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  // Create resources
  const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
  const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 'blue' });
  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  scene.add(mesh);
  
  // Return cleanup function
  return () => {
    // Remove from scene
    scene.remove(mesh);
    
    // Dispose of geometry
    geometry.dispose();
    
    // Dispose of material (including textures)
    if (material.map) material.map.dispose();
    material.dispose();
  };
}, [scene]);
```

This explicit approach to resource management is more verbose than R3F's automatic disposal but provides greater control and reliability.

### 3.3 Scene Management Patterns

The heart of WatermelonOS's architecture is the SceneManager component, which replaces R3F's Canvas and context providers. This component encapsulates the entire Three.js rendering lifecycle and provides a stable interface for child components.

```tsx
// SceneManager.client.tsx (simplified)
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import * as THREE from 'three';

export function SceneManager({ children, options = {} }) {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  const [sceneContext, setSceneContext] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!containerRef.current) return;
    
    // Initialize Three.js core objects
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, containerRef.current.clientWidth / containerRef.current.clientHeight, 0.1, 1000);
    camera.position.z = 5;
    
    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
      antialias: options.antialias ?? true,
      alpha: options.alpha ?? true,
    });
    renderer.setSize(containerRef.current.clientWidth, containerRef.current.clientHeight);
    containerRef.current.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
    
    // Animation management system
    const animations = new Map();
    let animationId = 0;
    
    const registerAnimation = (callback) => {
      const id = animationId++;
      animations.set(id, callback);
      return id;
    };
    
    const unregisterAnimation = (id) => {
      animations.delete(id);
    };
    
    // Animation loop
    const clock = new THREE.Clock();
    let requestId = null;
    
    const animate = () => {
      requestId = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
      
      const delta = clock.getDelta();
      const elapsed = clock.getElapsedTime();
      
      // Run all registered animations
      animations.forEach(callback => callback(delta, elapsed));
      
      // Render scene
      renderer.render(scene, camera);
    };
    
    // Start animation loop
    clock.start();
    animate();
    
    // Handle resize
    const handleResize = () => {
      if (!containerRef.current) return;
      
      const width = containerRef.current.clientWidth;
      const height = containerRef.current.clientHeight;
      
      camera.aspect = width / height;
      camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
      
      renderer.setSize(width, height);
    };
    
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    
    // Create scene context for children
    const ctx = {
      scene,
      camera,
      renderer,
      clock,
      registerAnimation,
      unregisterAnimation,
      domElement: renderer.domElement
    };
    
    setSceneContext(ctx);
    
    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
      // Stop animation loop
      if (requestId) {
        cancelAnimationFrame(requestId);
      }
      
      // Remove canvas from DOM
      if (containerRef.current && renderer.domElement) {
        containerRef.current.removeChild(renderer.domElement);
      }
      
      // Remove event listeners
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
      
      // Dispose of Three.js resources
      renderer.dispose();
      animations.clear();
    };
  }, [options]);
  
  return (
    <div 
      ref={containerRef} 
      style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%', position: 'relative' }}
    >
      {sceneContext && children(sceneContext)}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key aspects of this pattern include:

- **Explicit Scene Context**: Rather than using React context, the scene objects are passed explicitly to child components via a render prop pattern.
- **Animation Registration System**: Components register animation callbacks rather than using a hook like `useFrame`.
- **Resource Lifecycle Management**: The component handles initialization and cleanup of core Three.js resources.
- **Resize Handling**: Viewport adjustments are managed centrally rather than by individual components.

This approach provides a stable foundation for building complex 3D experiences while avoiding the SSR and lifecycle issues encountered with R3F.

### 3.4 Component Model Transformation

The transition from R3F's declarative component model to native Three.js required a fundamental shift in how components are structured and composed. This table illustrates the transformation of common patterns:

| R3F Pattern | Native Three.js Pattern |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| JSX scene hierarchy | Imperative object creation and scene addition |
| `useThree()` hook | Explicit `sceneContext` prop |
| `useFrame()` hook | Animation registration callback |
| Ref-based object access | Direct object variables in closure |
| Automatic disposal | Manual resource cleanup |
| Component props for object properties | Direct property assignment |

This transformation preserves the component boundaries and composition patterns that make React powerful while embracing the imperative nature of Three.js for actual 3D operations.

## 4. CODE MIGRATION EXAMPLES

### 4.1 Simple Object Component Migration

This example shows the migration of a basic R3F component to native Three.js.

**Original R3F Component:**

```tsx
// ColoredBox.tsx (R3F)
import { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'
import * as THREE from 'three'

export function ColoredBox({ position, color = 'blue' }) {
  const meshRef = useRef()
  const [hovered, setHovered] = useState(false)
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)
  
  useFrame((state, delta) => {
    meshRef.current.rotation.x += delta
    meshRef.current.rotation.y += delta * 0.5
  })
  
  return (
    <mesh
      position={position}
      ref={meshRef}
      scale={active ? 1.5 : 1}
      onClick={() => setActive(!active)}
      onPointerOver={() => setHovered(true)}
      onPointerOut={() => setHovered(false)}
    >
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color={hovered ? 'hotpink' : color} />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

**Migrated Native Three.js Component:**

```tsx
// ColoredBox.client.tsx (Native Three.js)
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'

export function ColoredBoxClient({ position, color = 'blue', sceneContext }) {
  const [hovered, setHovered] = useState(false)
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const { scene, camera, registerAnimation, unregisterAnimation } = sceneContext
    
    // Create geometry and material
    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
    const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
      color: hovered ? 'hotpink' : color
    })
    
    // Create mesh and set position
    const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
    mesh.position.set(...position)
    mesh.scale.set(active ? 1.5 : 1, active ? 1.5 : 1, active ? 1.5 : 1)
    
    // Add to scene
    scene.add(mesh)
    
    // Set up raycaster for interactions
    const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster()
    const pointer = new THREE.Vector2()
    
    const updatePointer = (event) => {
      pointer.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1
      pointer.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1
    }
    
    const handleClick = (event) => {
      updatePointer(event)
      raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera)
      
      const intersects = raycaster.intersectObject(mesh)
      if (intersects.length > 0) {
        setActive(!active)
      }
    }
    
    const checkHover = () => {
      raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera)
      const intersects = raycaster.intersectObject(mesh)
      
      const isHovered = intersects.length > 0
      if (isHovered !== hovered) {
        setHovered(isHovered)
      }
    }
    
    // Register mouse move listener
    window.addEventListener('mousemove', updatePointer)
    sceneContext.domElement.addEventListener('click', handleClick)
    
    // Register animation
    const animationId = registerAnimation((delta) => {
      mesh.rotation.x += delta
      mesh.rotation.y += delta * 0.5
      
      // Update material color based on hover state
      material.color.set(hovered ? 'hotpink' : color)
      
      // Update scale based on active state
      const targetScale = active ? 1.5 : 1
      mesh.scale.set(targetScale, targetScale, targetScale)
      
      // Check hover state
      checkHover()
    })
    
    // Clean up
    return () => {
      // Remove from scene
      scene.remove(mesh)
      
      // Dispose resources
      geometry.dispose()
      material.dispose()
      
      // Remove event listeners
      window.removeEventListener('mousemove', updatePointer)
      sceneContext.domElement.removeEventListener('click', handleClick)
      
      // Unregister animation
      unregisterAnimation(animationId)
    }
  }, [position, color, active, hovered, sceneContext])
  
  // Component doesn't render anything visible in React
  return null
}
```

### 4.2 Complex Component with Loaders

This example demonstrates migrating a component that loads external assets.

**Original R3F Component:**

```tsx
// ProductModel.tsx (R3F)
import { useRef, useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { useGLTF, useTexture, Html } from '@react-three/drei'
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'

export function ProductModel({ modelUrl, textureUrl, productName }) {
  const groupRef = useRef()
  const { nodes, materials } = useGLTF(modelUrl)
  const texture = useTexture(textureUrl)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  
  // Apply texture to material
  useEffect(() => {
    if (materials.Main) {
      materials.Main.map = texture
      materials.Main.needsUpdate = true
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }, [materials, texture])
  
  // Gentle rotation
  useFrame((state) => {
    groupRef.current.rotation.y = Math.sin(state.clock.elapsedTime * 0.3) * 0.2
  })
  
  return (
    <group ref={groupRef}>
      {loading ? (
        <Html center>
          <div>Loading model...</div>
        </Html>
      ) : (
        <>
          <mesh
            geometry={nodes.Body.geometry}
            material={materials.Main}
            castShadow
            receiveShadow
          />
          <mesh
            geometry={nodes.Details.geometry}
            material={materials.Secondary}
            castShadow
          />
        </>
      )}
      <Html position={[0, 2, 0]} center>
        <div className="product-label">{productName}</div>
      </Html>
    </group>
  )
}
```

**Migrated Native Three.js Component:**

```tsx
// ProductModel.client.tsx (Native Three.js)
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader'
import { CSS2DRenderer, CSS2DObject } from 'three/examples/jsm/renderers/CSS2DRenderer'

export function ProductModelClient({ 
  modelUrl, 
  textureUrl, 
  productName, 
  sceneContext 
}) {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const { scene, camera, registerAnimation, unregisterAnimation, renderer } = sceneContext

### 4.3 Shader Material Migration Example

This example demonstrates migrating custom shader materials from R3F to native Three.js.

**Original R3F Component:**

```tsx
// ShaderMaterial.tsx (R3F)
import { useRef } from 'react'
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'
import * as THREE from 'three'

// Vertex shader
const vertexShader = `
  varying vec2 vUv;
  void main() {
    vUv = uv;
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
  }
`

// Fragment shader
const fragmentShader = `
  uniform float time;
  uniform vec3 color;
  varying vec2 vUv;
  
  void main() {
    vec2 uv = vUv;
    float pattern = sin(uv.x * 10.0 + time) * sin(uv.y * 10.0 + time);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color * (0.5 + 0.5 * pattern), 1.0);
  }
`

export function WavyMaterial({ color = new THREE.Color(1, 0, 0) }) {
  const materialRef = useRef()
  
  useFrame((state) => {
    if (materialRef.current) {
      materialRef.current.uniforms.time.value = state.clock.elapsedTime
    }
  })
  
  return (
    <shaderMaterial
      ref={materialRef}
      vertexShader={vertexShader}
      fragmentShader={fragmentShader}
      uniforms={{
        time: { value: 0 },
        color: { value: color }
      }}
    />
  )
}

export function ShaderSphere() {
  return (
    <mesh>
      <sphereGeometry args={[1, 32, 32]} />
      <WavyMaterial color={new THREE.Color(0, 0.5, 1)} />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

**Migrated Native Three.js Component:**

```tsx
// ShaderMaterial.client.tsx (Native Three.js)
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'

// Vertex shader
const vertexShader = `
  varying vec2 vUv;
  void main() {
    vUv = uv;
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
  }
`

// Fragment shader
const fragmentShader = `
  uniform float time;
  uniform vec3 color;
  varying vec2 vUv;
  
  void main() {
    vec2 uv = vUv;
    float pattern = sin(uv.x * 10.0 + time) * sin(uv.y * 10.0 + time);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color * (0.5 + 0.5 * pattern), 1.0);
  }
`

export function ShaderSphereClient({ sceneContext }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const { scene, registerAnimation, unregisterAnimation } = sceneContext
    
    // Create geometry
    const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32)
    
    // Create shader material
    const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
      vertexShader,
      fragmentShader,
      uniforms: {
        time: { value: 0 },
        color: { value: new THREE.Color(0, 0.5, 1) }
      }
    })
    
    // Create mesh
    const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
    scene.add(mesh)
    
    // Register animation to update shader uniform
    const animationId = registerAnimation((_, elapsed) => {
      material.uniforms.time.value = elapsed
    })
    
    // Clean up
    return () => {
      scene.remove(mesh)
      geometry.dispose()
      material.dispose()
      unregisterAnimation(animationId)
    }
  }, [sceneContext])
  
  return null
}
```

### 4.4 Code Diff Comparisons

The following tables highlight the key differences in the migration process:

**Component Structure Differences:**

| R3F Pattern | Native Three.js Equivalent | Notes |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------|
| `<Canvas>...</Canvas>` | `<SceneManager>{ctx => ...}</SceneManager>` | SceneManager uses render props for context |
| `<mesh>` JSX element | `new THREE.Mesh()` | Direct object creation |
| Nested components | Explicit object hierarchy | Parent-child relationships are explicit |
| Props for properties | Direct property assignment | `position={[x,y,z]}` → `mesh.position.set(x,y,z)` |
| Automatic disposal | Manual cleanup | Explicit resource disposal in useEffect cleanup |

**Scene and Resource Management:**

| R3F Pattern | Native Three.js Equivalent | Notes |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------|
| `const { scene } = useThree()` | `const { scene } = sceneContext` | Explicit context vs. hooks |
| `useFrame((state) => {...})` | `registerAnimation((delta) => {...})` | Registration vs. hooks |
| `useLoader(GLTFLoader, url)` | `new GLTFLoader().load(url, callback)` | Promise vs. callbacks |
| React refs | Local variables | Direct object references |
| Context for global state | Props for local state | Explicit prop passing |

**Event Handling Differences:**

| R3F Pattern | Native Three.js Equivalent | Notes |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------|
| `onPointerOver={handler}` | Manual raycasting + event listeners | Explicit raycasting required |
| `onClick={handler}` | DOM event + raycasting check | Event delegation vs. synthetic events |
| Automatic event propagation | Manual event bubbling | Event propagation must be implemented |
| Pointer event normalization | Browser-specific event handling | Mobile/touch events need explicit handling |

These code examples demonstrate the systematic transformation of components from R3F's declarative model to the more explicit native Three.js approach, while preserving the component boundaries and functionality.

The performance improvements translate directly to business metrics, with the most significant gains seen in mobile conversion rates where performance constraints are most noticeable.

## 6. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE

### 6.1 The R3F Developer Experience

React Three Fiber has gained popularity largely due to its developer-friendly approach to 3D development. Key aspects of this experience include:

**Declarative Syntax**: R3F's JSX-based scene definition feels natural to React developers, with familiar patterns for composition and prop passing.

**Component Abstractions**: Common Three.js patterns are encapsulated in reusable components, reducing boilerplate code and cognitive load.

**React Integration**: Seamless access to React features like state, context, and hooks makes it easy to connect 3D content with application logic.

**Rapid Iteration**: The combination of hot module replacement and declarative updates enables fast feedback cycles during development.

To maintain development velocity while transitioning to native Three.js, we needed to preserve these advantages while addressing the underlying architectural issues.

### 6.2 Preserving Developer Experience

Our approach to maintaining a positive developer experience focused on creating abstractions that bridge the gap between React's component model and Three.js's imperative API:

**Component Patterns**: We established consistent patterns for Three.js components that mirror React's lifecycle and composition models.

**Developer Tooling**: Custom ESLint rules and TypeScript types ensure proper resource management and help catch common mistakes.

**Utility Hooks**: Custom React hooks abstract common Three.js patterns while maintaining explicit control over the rendering lifecycle.

**Comprehensive Examples**: An extensive library of example components demonstrates best practices and provides reusable patterns.

For example, this utility hook simplifies animation management while maintaining the native Three.js approach:

```tsx
// useAnimation.ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export function useAnimation(
  callback,
  sceneContext,
  dependencies = []
) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Skip if no context
    if (!sceneContext) return;
    
    // Register animation callback
    const id = sceneContext.registerAnimation(callback);
    
    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
      sceneContext.unregisterAnimation(id);
    };
  }, [callback, sceneContext, ...dependencies]);
}

// Usage example
function RotatingObject({ object, speed, sceneContext }) {
  useAnimation((delta) => {
    if (object) {
      object.rotation.y += delta * speed;
    }
  }, sceneContext, [object, speed]);
  
  return null;
}
```

This approach preserves the convenience of R3F's hooks while maintaining explicit control over the Three.js lifecycle.

![Developer Experience Diagram](https://assets.nudun.io/whitepapers/r3f-to-threejs/developer-experience.svg)

### 6.3 Migration Patterns

To facilitate the transition from existing R3F components to the native Three.js approach, we developed a systematic migration methodology:

**1. Isolate Three.js Logic**
- Identify all Three.js-specific code in the R3F component
- Separate rendering logic from state management
- Map R3F hooks to their native Three.js equivalents

**2. Convert JSX to Imperative Code**
- Transform JSX element hierarchy to imperative object creation
- Convert prop assignments to direct object property setting
- Replace nested components with function calls or object composition

**3. Implement Resource Management**
- Add explicit resource creation in setup phase
- Add comprehensive resource disposal in cleanup phase
- Ensure proper disposal order to prevent errors

**4. Adapt Event Handling**
- Replace R3F's synthetic events with native Three.js raycasting
- Implement pointer event management compatible with React's event system
- Preserve interaction behaviors while using native Three.js approaches

**5. Integrate with Shopify Context**
- Connect to Hydrogen's data sources and state management
- Implement proper metafield access for configuration
- Ensure all commerce functionality remains intact
