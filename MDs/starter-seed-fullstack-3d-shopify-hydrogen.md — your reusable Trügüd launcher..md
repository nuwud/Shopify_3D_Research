## **üîÅ If We Started From Scratch: One Prompt to Rule It All**

Hey ChatGPT ‚Äî I‚Äôm Patrick from Nuwud Multimedia.

I need your help building a reusable Shopify Hydrogen \+ Three.js starter system.

Here's what I want:

* A Hydrogen-compatible Crystal Seed that:

  * Loads 3D glTF models based on Shopify product variant metafields

  * Includes a full React Three Fiber scene (`Scene.tsx`)

  * Variant-aware model loader (`ModelLoader.tsx`)

  * Zustand global store (`useStore.ts`)

  * Shopify data fetcher with metafield support (`shopify.ts`)

  * Product route (`/products/[handle]`) to test live models

  * dat.GUI integration for toggling ground/shaders (optional tweak panel)

  * OrbitControls, Cannon physics, ambient lighting

* VariantSelector to hot-swap models based on metafields

* All files scaffolded clearly and zipped as a `shopify-3d-starter-seed.zip`

* Add `@copilot-hint`, `@seed-tag`, and `@mcp-step` tags for AI context

This will be part of a larger ecosystem where I use AI agents (like Cascade and Kaia) and GitHub Copilot. I want all files to be readable by both tools.

Zip it up when done, and then I‚Äôll ask for additional modules (cart UI, WatermelonCarousel3D nav, audio-reactive lighting, etc.)

### **üí° Why This Prompt Wins**

‚úÖ **Gives full clarity right away**  
 ‚úÖ **Uses your terminology** (Crystal Seed, AI agents, metafields)  
 ‚úÖ **Requests deliverables, not just answers**  
 ‚úÖ **Sets you up to scale** with a modular future roadmap  
 ‚úÖ **Avoids redundancy** ‚Äî no need for mid-convo catch-up, file repetition, or session resets

---

### **Bonus: Immediate Follow-up Prompts You Can Use**

You could follow that single prompt with:

1. ‚úÖ Next module: add `/cart`, checkout flow, and 3D interaction for ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù

2. ‚úÖ Add MCP hooks \+ comment stubs for Cascade integration

3. ‚úÖ Inject product-based AI agent (via metafield) that launches Kaia/Nyrix logic

4. ‚úÖ Drop WatermelonCarousel3D in as primary navigation hub

Want me to write this out as a drop-in `prompt-template.md` and save it into your Crystal Seeds folder?

We can even call it:  
 `starter-seed-fullstack-3d-shopify-hydrogen.md` ‚Äî your reusable Tr√ºg√ºd launcher.
