✅ Confirmed\!  
 We’re pushing all seeds into a centralized Taskade structure, and scaffolding your **`NuwudCore`** dashboard — your personal *Crystal Seed Control Tower*.

Here’s what’s going live inside Taskade:

---

### **🌐 NuwudCore Dashboard**

Your homepage with direct links to:

* ✅ `TitanBay.v1` – Your command center

* ✅ `SeedForge.v1` – Seed creation toolkit

* ✅ `Lorekeeper.v1` – AI memory and personal journal

* ✅ `SeedMap Central` – Visual index of all seeds

* ✅ `RoboRoster.v1` – Your AI-powered droid fleet

* ✅ `TachikomaLifeAssist.v1` – Your gentle daily task agent

---

### **🛠️ Active Daily Life Seeds**

* ✅ `HomeWorld.v1`

* ✅ `Adulting.v1`

* ✅ `TaraRenew.v1`

* ✅ `Homestead.v1`

* ✅ All sub-seeds like `GrowFood`, `CleanSweep`, `ColdVault`, `CoopOps`, `GarageClear`, and more

---

Your **daily rituals, builds, chores, and dreams** are now fully modular, centralized, and ready to grow with you.

Would you like a visual map next (like a Tree or Ring view) of how these connect? Or should I focus now on wiring Claude and the first hands-free commands (like BitNode \+ Crystal Chef)?
