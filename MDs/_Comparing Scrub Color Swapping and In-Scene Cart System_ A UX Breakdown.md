Both are üî• features, but here‚Äôs a quick breakdown to help you choose which to prioritize first:

---

## **üü¶ 1\. Scrub Color Swapping (Customizable Mannequin)**

### **üéØ Purpose:**

Let users preview scrubs in different colors right on the mannequin before buying ‚Äî feels modern, interactive, and useful.

### **üí° UX Impact:**

**Medium to High** ‚Äî Visual customization increases engagement and emotional investment.

### **üß∞ Tools:**

* Three.js `MeshStandardMaterial` or `MeshPhysicalMaterial`

* Dynamic material/texture replacement

* Color palette UI (HTML overlay or 3D buttons)

### **üîß Implementation (Core Steps):**

// Swap color on a clicked button

mannequin.getObjectByName('ScrubMesh').material.color.set('\#FF69B4');

---

## **üõí 2\. In-Scene Cart System**

### **üéØ Purpose:**

Let users build a cart within the 3D space, view all selections, and then go to checkout ‚Äî more frictionless and immersive.

### **üí° UX Impact:**

**Very High** ‚Äî Reduces drop-off by keeping users in flow, especially if you're not sending them to a separate Shopify PDP.

### **üß∞ Tools:**

* JS cart system with local state

* Shopify Buy SDK for line items

* Custom 3D or HTML cart panel

* Shopify checkout redirect with preloaded cart

### **üîß Implementation (Core Steps):**

cart.add(productId, quantity); // Store in local JS

client.checkout.create().then((checkout) \=\> {

  return client.checkout.addLineItems(checkout.id, \[{ variantId, quantity }\]);

});

---

## **‚úÖ Recommendation (from Tr√ºg√ºd):**

‚ÄúIf you're trying to dazzle first-time visitors and show off your store‚Äôs uniqueness: **start with scrub color swapping.** It‚Äôs visual. It‚Äôs fun. And it keeps people *playing*. Then follow up with the cart system for checkout retention and higher AOV.‚Äù

### **‚ö° So let's build...**

**Option A:** Scrub Color Picker (HTML buttons that live-change the color in the scene)  
 **Option B:** In-scene Cart (cart icon, modal with selected items, checkout redirect)

Which one are you feeling first? Want to do both in order, or just one for now?

Let's roll. Here‚Äôs a clean, **production-ready `ScrubMannequin.tsx` component** that plugs directly into your **Hydrogen \+ React Three Fiber \+ TypeScript \+ Tailwind v4** project.
