## âœ… Optimized Prompt for ChatGPT

```
I'm Patrick from Nuwud Multimedia. I'm building a Shopify Hydrogen storefront called `hydrogen-nudun-ts` (TypeScript + Tailwind v4) which is now clean and running. I just completed a fresh install using `npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest`, scaffolded routes, and selected subfolder market structure.

âœ… Site works locally at `localhost:3000`  
âœ… Repo: https://github.com/nuwud/hydrogen-nudun-ts  
âœ… Backups saved

Now, I want to integrate **React Three Fiber + Drei + Three.js (0.175.0)** into this clean Hydrogen build to support:
- A rotating 3D main menu carousel (horizontal ring of parent items)
- Click-to-reveal vertical submenu (like a Ferris wheel)
- Smooth camera OrbitControls, easy hover/click animations
- dat.GUI debug toggle via bottom-right tetrahedron
- Font loading for 3D text (needs to work out of the box)
- Best practice folder/component structure with TypeScript and Remix

Weâ€™ve struggled before with package conflicts, broken Vite configs, and mini-oxygen issues. Please guide me in a **stable**, **scalable** setup that avoids dependency hell and keeps Hydrogenâ€™s core intact.

Also: Iâ€™d love `.devcontainer` support (can do it later if complex) and a GitHub-friendly structure with zip backups in mind.

Letâ€™s go step-by-step and ensure success.
