\- CSS2D Command Console with unlock buttons that trigger voice feedback and light burst FX  
\- Persistent upgrade state via localStorage, with optional Firebase sync  
\- Holographic ring UI that spins in \`holoMode\`, using GLSL pulse shaders  
\- A progress ring that shifts color based on % of upgrades unlocked (HSL-based)  
\- Modular theme system with presets (default, danger, spirit), switchable at runtime  
\- A floating UI toolbar (\`SeedOS Toolbar\`) that includes:  
  \- Theme switcher buttons  
  \- Prompt text area for seeding AI code ideas  
  \- ‚ÄúGenerate Seed‚Äù button (mock or linked)  
\- All components delivered as modular JS files with clear comments
