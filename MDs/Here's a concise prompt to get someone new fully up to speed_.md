**üéØ Prompt:**

I'm building a lean, storytelling-driven marketing system for my agency, Nuwud Multimedia, to land high-ticket Shopify Plus clients (targeting $10K+ contracts at $250/hr). We‚Äôre using Taskade to manage this campaign with the latest features like AI Agents, Agent Teams, Roundtable Mode, and Automation Filters. The goal is to turn a $100 marketing budget into real client acquisition within 14 days.

The setup includes:

* A modular Taskade workspace with stages for lead generation, outreach, retargeting ads, authority content, landing page optimization, and closing.

* AI Agents for lead scraping, personalized cold outreach, ad campaign management, sales call analysis, and storytelling content generation (case studies, audit videos, LinkedIn posts).

* Storytelling is the core of the strategy (inspired by Amish techniques) to emotionally connect with prospects across outreach, ads, landing pages, and calls.

* Retargeting ads and mini case studies support a free ‚ÄúShopify Plus Growth Audit‚Äù offer to warm up leads.

Need help building or optimizing this AI-powered sales funnel, enhancing storytelling hooks, and executing through Taskade. Let‚Äôs make this system client-ready fast.
