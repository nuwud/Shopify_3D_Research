I just found out that Shopify has 3D products built in. They even have an app to scan products to turn them into 3D. I think that's marvelous. And I think that's definitely something we need to take advantage of when it comes to our, you know, React 3 Fiber and 3.js and TypeScript and everything else we're doing with the hydrogen and mini-oxygen programming. We really need to use as much of the Shopify native abilities as possible. Because if we can have a 3D hydrogen app and then plug in a 3D product, you can actually look at the product from all sides and not just inside a box or something. You know, like, you can be going around the wheel yourself. We can have different functions for how the user can use it with their mouse or with their phone. We'll see where it goes from there.

That's excellent. I feel like you can go even deeper and do even more research, please. So, do that. And on a side note, I was thinking about this. For our product, we're going to be selling those crystals, right? The crystal seeds. And they're going to be really cool, but I feel like they should all be like our 3JS ball. They should be like this layered crystalline thing that does crazy things just to the touch, right? But it should also have whatever its abilities are, and it should also be kind of like a bit where it talks to you, you know? Probably more than just yes or no, but maybe variations of that. And then, I feel like it'd be really cool in an extra touch if we made them like, if we linked them up with NFT. I mean, I don't have any money right now, but I mean, eventually, or maybe if we, once they pay us, you know, we have to build it for them anyway. Like, and we can always maintain them and stuff, and so like, we're always going to have a link to them anyway, but there should be an NFT to them. So when you buy it, you have true ownership, and it has like, you know, some kind of like link to whatever that is, you know? I don't fully understand it, even if I did study it a little bit, but I didn't really grasp it. And this is like the first really useful thing I can think of for it, because everything else is like memberships and things like that. And this, in a sense, is a membership, but you know, we're going to have tolls along the way. We're not going to just like, oh, lifetime membership. I can't afford that.

jsx  
Copy  
`import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';`  
`import { useDrag } from 'react-use-gesture';`  
`import { useRef } from 'react';`

`function Crystal() {`  
  `const meshRef = useRef();`

  `const bind = useDrag(({ offset: [x, y] }) => {`  
    `meshRef.current.rotation.y = x / 100;`  
    `meshRef.current.rotation.x = y / 100;`  
  `});`

  `return (`  
    `<mesh {...bind()} ref={meshRef}>`  
      `{/* Geometry and Material */}`  
    `</mesh>`  
  `);`  
`}`

`function App() {`  
  `return (`  
    `<Canvas>`

That's a bit much right now. I want to stay focused on Shopify and selling my crystals inside Shopify, inside a 3D space, more or less frameless, you know? And then, uh, we'll go from there.Remember, the stack we're working with is React 3 Fiber, 3.js, TypeScript Tailwind version 4, and we've got a bunch of other cool stuff. And then, yeah, we'll go from there.We might need to develop an app that the purchaser can use in order to give their crystal a home with the environment that it needs.

If I was a store owner, and I owned one of these stores, like, uh, let's say Arthur Lucero owns Fitscrubs.com, and he has all these employees, and it needs to be super easy for one of them, who's, you know, they're only so tech-savvy. I mean, they know how to use Slack, and they know how to do a few things, but I mostly forbid them from touching the site, because even their most advanced, uh, guy really would just mess it up, you know? And, plus I gotta control a few things, and the whole thing, but, uh, yeah. Let's keep things like that in mind, like, let's say they got the scrubs, alright? If, uh, I'm one of Arthur's employees, and I'm just like, Patrick came up with this new fangled thing, I don't know how to use it, we need to have this thing as easy to use as a video game, maybe with one of those tutorials, the way video games do, teach you how to use it, and, uh, teach them how to, like, scan the clothes, uh, how to put them in, uh, how they can use mannequins, they can use the, uh, models, they can do whatever they want, you know? Like, if it was me, I would probably use a, a green mannequin, and then, uh, take the green part out, or maybe use a white one, or a black one, whatever works, you know, something neutral. And then, uh, what else? Uh, I just want to make it really easy for them to just insert the product. As a matter of fact, it would probably be a lot easier if they used mannequins than models, alright? And then they use their phone, they scan it in, and then, voila, the product's inside the product, they've just selected their new 3D scan, maybe they or I make a few adjustments, but they need to do the scanning on their end, and then just insert it into their new 3D store, uh, maybe place it like, uh, uh, the way a fashion merchandiser would, you know, inside a 3D store, and all that stuff needs to be easy for them.The DAT GUI is really awesome, but at the same time, what we need is a really easy-to-use user interface for the end user who's going to be using it inside the customizer. And so all that stuff needs to be really easily accessible, or maybe even in its own, like, page, where, like, they don't even have to go inside the back end of Shopify, you know? Maybe it has its own URL or something like that, where I can at least monitor it from our end.

Combine the `Canvas` and `Model` components to render the 3D model:​

 tsx  
Copy  
`import ThreeDCanvas from './ThreeDCanvas';`  
`import Model from './Model';`

`const App = () => {`  
  `return (`  
    `<div className="h-screen">`  
      `<ThreeDCanvas>`  
        `<ambientLight />`  
        `<pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />`  
        `<Model modelPath="/path-to-your-model.glb" />`  
      `</ThreeDCanvas>`  
    `</div>`  
  `);`  
`};`

`export default App;`

* 

**3\. Styling with Tailwind CSS**

* **Applying Utility Classes:**

Use Tailwind's utility classes to style your components efficiently:​

 tsx  
Copy  
`<div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen bg-gray-100">`
