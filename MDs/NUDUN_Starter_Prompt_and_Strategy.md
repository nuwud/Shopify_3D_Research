This file contains a highly optimized, context-rich prompt and structured plan to initialize or reinitialize the NUDUN project for new collaborators or AI assistance.

## ðŸ”§ Ideal Prompt to Begin NUDUN Cleanly

Iâ€™m building a modular 3D Shopify theme system in Three.js called **NUDUN**, where every GUI element (from Dawn or custom) becomes a reusable 3D prefab. I want:

- A modular scene/GUI loader
- A prefab system with crystal seeds (code + config per prefab)
- AI-resilient dev tools (auto-backups, versioning, embedded prompts)
- Support for donations (Stripe/PayPal), marketplace assets, licensing
- Accessibility features (TTS, spatial cues, keyboard nav)
- A real-world legal/IP strategy I can start on my own, then hand off to an IP attorney

Iâ€™m a solo dev and caregiver, so I need clarity, automation, and long-term leverage.  
Give me:
- The ideal project folder structure
- A working prefab loader
- First prefab component (NavOrb3D or SupportCrystal3D)
- Legal/IP tracking system
- Markdown project summary and contributor onboarding guide

## âœ… Output Checklist for a Clean Start

### 1. Folder Structure:
```
NUDUN/
  â”œâ”€â”€ NUDUN-Core/
  â”œâ”€â”€ prefabs/
  â”œâ”€â”€ scenes/
  â”œâ”€â”€ debug/
  â”œâ”€â”€ editor/
  â”œâ”€â”€ vision/
  â””â”€â”€ marketplace/
```

### 2. First Files to Generate:
- `SceneLoader3D.js`
- `prefabs/NavOrb3D/NavOrb3D.js` + config
- `scenes/old-west-town/scene.json`
- `debug/ARC_Core.js` (for backups + notes)
- `NUDUN_IP_Attorney_Tracker.txt`
- `NUDUN_Contributor_Onboarding.md`
- `NUDUN_Project_Summary.md`

### 3. Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Overbuilding before first prefab works
- IP confusion (no structure for contributor licenses)
- Code bloat (build modular and AI-readable)
- Forgetting personal limits: start with what earns time/money now

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

> "Every prefab you finish is one less dollar you have to chase."  
> "Every crystal you seed is a world ready to pay you back."

Use this prompt + checklist whenever you need to reboot the system, scale your team, or explain your world to an AI.
