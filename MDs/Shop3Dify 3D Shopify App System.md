Absolutely, Patrick — here's a **clean summary of where we’re at in this thread** so you can pick things up anytime or hand it off easily.

## **📍 Current Status: Shop3Dify 3D Shopify App System**

You're building a **modular, client-editable Shopify App** using **React Three Fiber** and **Three.js**, integrated into Shopify via both:

* **Theme Section** (for storefront embedding)

* **Custom App Backend** (Node.js \+ Shopify API)

---

## **✅ What’s Been Completed**

### **🔧 Scaffolded Systems**

* Vite \+ React \+ Three.js frontend

* Node.js backend with Shopify API auth

* `three-scene.liquid` theme section for Shopify theme integration

### **🧠 Scene Architecture**

* Dual-mode config: `focus` (single product) and `explore` (multi-product)

* JSON-based config (position, rotation, lighting, labels)

* Sample configs created (`config-focus.json`, `config-explore.json`)

### **🛠️ 3D Scene Logic**

* Three.js scene dynamically reads config via `data-config-url`

* Renders 3D product hotspots or spotlight sphere

* Uses `TransformControls` for **drag-and-drop hotspot positioning**

### **🧾 Live Config Editor**

* React-based sidebar UI

* Live sync with scene state

* Download updated config as JSON
