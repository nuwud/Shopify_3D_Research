### **ðŸ§  Crystal Summary Prompt: Shopify Hydrogen \+ 3D System**

Hey ChatGPT â€” Iâ€™m building a modular, AI-ready Shopify Hydrogen \+ Three.js storefront.

Weâ€™ve already designed a reusable Crystal Seed architecture that includes:

* Hydrogen v3+ with `/products/[handle]` dynamic route

* React Three Fiber 3D scene with OrbitControls, Cannon physics, and ambient lighting

* `ModelLoader.tsx` loads glTF models dynamically based on Shopify variant metafields

* Zustand-powered `useStore.ts` for 3D model state \+ toggles

* `VariantSelector.tsx` hot-swaps 3D models using metafields

* `DebugPanel.tsx` adds dat.GUI controls for live scene tweaks

* `shopify.ts` handles Hydrogen product queries \+ metafields

All files are AI-tagged (`@seed-tag`, `@mcp-step`, `@copilot-hint`) for Copilot and future MCP agents like Cascade.

This project is part of a larger AI-driven Shopify/NUDUN ecosystem. I need you to help me:

* Maintain modular clarity

* Avoid redundancy

* Expand into cart logic, audio-reactive scenes, or agent-based product interactions

Whatâ€™s the next best move to scale this seed?

Would you like me to:

* Save this as `seed-summary-prompt.md` in your repo or seeds folder?

* Write a follow-up prompt for someone *non-technical* (e.g. client, team member)?

Letâ€™s keep this ecosystem navigable by humans *and* AI.
