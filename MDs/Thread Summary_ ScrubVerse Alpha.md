## **🧵 Thread Summary: ScrubVerse Alpha**

### **🎯 Project Goal**

You're building a **fully interactive, 3D nurse scrub retail store** using:

* **Three.js / React Three Fiber**

* **Hydrogen (Shopify Plus theme)**

* **TypeScript, Tailwind v4, ESLint**

* Hosted on **OxygenMini** or similar

Your goal is to revolutionize nurse apparel shopping by blending visual interactivity, smart AI UX, and direct Shopify checkout — all within a modular, scalable system.

## **✅ What We've Done**

### **🔹 Core Boilerplate Provided**

* R3F scene with mannequins and color swapping

* Tailwind overlay for UI

* Shopify Buy SDK integration (basic)

* Raycasting for click interactions

### **🔹 Identified All Major Features**

You confirmed you’re ready to build:

1. 🔄 **Live Variant-Based Scrub Swaps**  
    Pull from Shopify metadata and auto-update the 3D scene.

2. 🧠 **AI Fit Recommender UX**  
    Fit wizard that suggests the ideal size based on user profile.

3. 🧬 **Size/Pocket/Brand Modular System**  
    Full scrub configurator using GLTF mesh swapping and Shopify metafields.

4. 📦 **Hydrogen Component Library**  
    Clean, reusable, type-safe components to support your store's front and future projects.

---

## **🧱 Next Steps (Prep for Dev)**

To build out everything:

* Provide a sample **GLTF mannequin model** with named scrub mesh

* A real **Shopify product with variants**

* Any **texture files** or sample fabric images you want to use

* If available: a sketch or mental map of your **modular UI vision**

(If not ready, I can generate placeholders and mock products to move ahead.)
