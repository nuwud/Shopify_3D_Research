Awesome â€” weâ€™ve kicked things off\! ðŸŽ‰ The canvas above now holds:

### **âœ… Initial Hydrogen-Ready Modules (React Three Fiber)**

1. `Ball.tsx`: Basic rotating sphere with physical material.

2. `AudioEngine.tsx`: Hook that initializes sine wave audio (modular & clean).

3. `SpikyEffect.tsx`: Adds randomized vertex distortion (spike mode) with configurable strength.

---

### **ðŸ”§ Coming Up Next (Phased)**

* `GradientTexture.tsx`: Audio-reactive gradient for the ball.

* `MotionTrail.tsx`: Trail mesh that follows the ball.

* `BallVisualizer.tsx`: Unified wrapper with props like `spiky`, `audio`, `gradient`, `trail`.

* Zustand or reducer-based toggle state.

* Tailwind-integrated HUD for UI toggles (Hydrogen-ready).

* Vanilla JS mirror modules for each feature.

Would you like me to:

* **Continue building directly in this file**, expanding feature by feature?

* Or split these into **separate files per component** and give you a downloadable Hydrogen-ready zip?

Also â€” want me to begin creating the **vanilla JS version of these same modules in parallel** now?
