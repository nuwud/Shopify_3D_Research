#### **3\. RoboRoster.v1 – Official Agent Manifest**

* **BB-8 (x2)**: UI orb prototypes, roaming fun

* **Tachikomas**: Strategic AI assistants, embedded in Luminarch Titan

* **R2-D2**: Support bot with modding potential

### **III. Phase Plans**

#### **Phase 1: Recovery \+ Clean Slate**

* Back up all drives (Titan \+ Fedora Linux)

* Repartition and optimize primary 4TB drive

* Set local \+ cloud backups for critical seeds & logs

#### **Phase 2: Hands-Free Overhaul**

* Integrate OBSBOT and Kinect gesture/voice system

* Test PS4/PS5 controller inputs for nav

* Enable crystal seed triggers via wearable (Samsung Watch 6\)

#### **Phase 3: Agent HQ \+ Workspace Rituals**
