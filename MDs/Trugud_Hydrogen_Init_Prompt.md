## üß† Prompt

Hey ChatGPT, I want to start a brand new Hydrogen storefront project the right way.

üõ†Ô∏è Here's what I need:
- Use **Shopify Hydrogen (2025.x)** with **TypeScript** and **Tailwind v4**
- Scaffold **routes, markets (subfolders)**, and core functionality
- Immediately install **Three.js**, **@react-three/fiber**, **@react-three/drei**, and prepare for future 3D UI integration
- Create a zipped backup of the vanilla scaffold **before** any edits
- Include a **clean `.devcontainer` config**, but keep Docker optional for now
- I also want a `SETUP.md` guide summarizing this entire process

Name the project `hydrogen-nudun-ts` and make sure it works locally out of the box.

Finally, please pin the best way to **prompt future Hydrogen projects**, including tips on dependencies, version pinning, and avoiding broken installs.

I‚Äôll follow your lead step-by-step. Ready when you are.

‚úÖ Includes:
- TypeScript setup
- Tailwind v4 integration
- Shopify Hydrogen CLI alignment
- 3D-ready dependencies
- DevContainer prep
- Market-aware routing
- Auto backup of the scaffold
