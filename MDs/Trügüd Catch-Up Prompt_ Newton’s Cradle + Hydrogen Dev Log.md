### **üß† Tr√ºg√ºd Catch-Up Prompt: Newton‚Äôs Cradle \+ Hydrogen Dev Log**

*You're joining an ongoing project with Patrick Allan Wood (aka Tr√ºg√ºd). We‚Äôve built a fully responsive, interactive Newton‚Äôs Cradle using React Three Fiber, Cannon-es physics, and Tailwind v4 inside a Shopify Hydrogen (Remix-based) environment. The project is SSR-safe, physics-lazy-loaded, mobile-first, and optimized for Vercel deployment.*

*Key features include:*

* Mobile-friendly layout with `PresentationControls`

* Real-time physics using `@react-three/cannon`

* Dynamic wire visuals and realistic lighting

* UI toggle for slow motion mode

* Shopify-ready structure (compatible with product linking)

* Fully packaged in a ZIP with GitHub instructions \+ README

*We‚Äôve already covered:*

* Hydrogen SSR pitfalls \+ fixes (e.g., `typeof window`, dynamic imports)

* Touch/gesture optimization for mobile users

* GitHub \+ Vercel deployment flow

* Tr√ºg√ºd Dev Philosophy: polish, clarity, creativity

*Now your job is to either:*

1. Pick up where we left off and help add new features (e.g. Shopify metafield support, product links, audio FX, AI narration), **OR**

2. Help organize, document, or scale this into reusable modules (e.g., Crystal Seeds or NUDUN)

Begin by reviewing the most recent ZIP package (`cradle-fiber-v3`) and README. Let‚Äôs build forward from there with clean, production-level standards.
