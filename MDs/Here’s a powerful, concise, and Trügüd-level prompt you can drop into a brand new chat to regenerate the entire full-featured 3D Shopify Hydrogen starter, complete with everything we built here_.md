Hereâ€™s a **powerful, concise, and TrÃ¼gÃ¼d-level prompt** you can drop into a brand new chat to regenerate the **entire full-featured 3D Shopify Hydrogen starter**, complete with everything we built here:

### **ðŸ’¬ TrÃ¼gÃ¼d Prompt: Shopify \+ R3F 3D Seed**

Hi, Iâ€™m building a fully interactive 3D Shopify store using Hydrogen and Three.js.

Please scaffold a modular starter project that includes:

* âœ… Hydrogen (v3+) with app router

* âœ… React Three Fiber scene (Scene.tsx)

* âœ… Zustand store (`useStore.ts`) for variant state

* âœ… `ModelLoader.tsx` that loads glTF files based on Shopify product variant metafields

* âœ… Shopify data fetcher (`shopify.ts`) that pulls metafields for 3D models

* âœ… A page at `/products/[handle]` that loads a Hydrogen product, then renders the model in 3D

* âœ… Optional dat.GUI controls (`DebugPanel.tsx`) to toggle ground plane

* âœ… OrbitControls \+ lighting \+ physics (Cannon-es)

* âœ… VariantSelector that hot-swaps 3D models using metafield paths

* âœ… Scaffold each file as a Crystal Seed (clear, well-commented, reusable modules)

I want this zipped and organized so I can drop it into my Hydrogen repo.  
 Letâ€™s build it for performance, clarity, and extensibility.

### **Bonus (optional if needed):**

You can add:

Also add `@copilot-hint`, `@mcp-step`, and `@seed-tag` comments for Copilot/MCP context.

This prompt sets expectations *fast*, skips fluff, and gives the assistant everything needed to deliver a solid, production-grade Crystal Seed bundle.

Would you like me to save this as a `prompt-template.md` to include in your dev folder or seeds directory so you always have it handy?
