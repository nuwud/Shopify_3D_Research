## 🛠️ Custom Seed Format (for use with SeedOS Toolbar)
```json
{
  "type": "hud",
  "name": "Console",
  "features": ["floating", "upgrade-buttons", "voice-trigger"],
  "theme": "spirit"
}

## 🧠 Trügüd Reminder
You are the architect. Every seed builds on the last. When in doubt:

> **“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding...”**  
> _— Proverbs 3:5-6_

Stay grounded. Keep building.
